i made a platformer game where there are 5 levels each one having new things added to them to make them diffrent like moving platforms, enemies, movable block and more. 

and for my level select is diffrent because it cant work as links cause if it was it will only show up as the starting level or what i last opened on constuct 2 so i 
made a button to take you to a level select to each level
